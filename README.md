# workday_interview_tech_test
All the data and code associated with the workday interview process.

I have done some practice to prepare for the test and here is the link to the repo https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises

All the code done is stored in src...the sql queries will stored here as well and will be uploaded soon.

The data is 1470 rows and has a snapshot of the employee features that are typically handled in a day to day scenario.
